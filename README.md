# EnlightenðŸ’¡: An energy audit app to save money ðŸ’¸ and the environment ðŸŒ±!

## Project Rationale
This app was created as part of my IB Computer Science Course in which we were tasked with creating an app to fulfill a client's needs.

My client specified that the app must have the following functionality: 
1) Calculate and display individual home appliance electricity usage
2) Provide the user with clear methods and tips to reduce consumption
