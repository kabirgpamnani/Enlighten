# EnlightenðŸ’¡: An energy audit app to save money ðŸ’¸ and the environment ðŸŒ±!

## Project Rationale
This app was created as part of my IB Computer Science Course in which we were tasked with creating an app to fulfill a client's needs.

My client specified that the app must have the following functionality: 
1) Calculate and display individual home appliance electricity usage
2) Provide the user with clear methods and tips to reduce consumption

## Development server
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.1.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
